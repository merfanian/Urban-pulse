We do not lemmatize since we observed that some subcrimes gets deleted and to keep things simple, here we void lemmatization. \n",

    "  - **Accuracy:** 82%\n",

    "  - **F1-Score (Positive):** 0.88\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Implementation Details\n",
    "- Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text reviews to numerical features\n",
    "- Applied train-test split (80-20)\n",
    "- Used balanced class weights to handle class imbalance\n",
    "- Evaluated using classification report with precision, recall, and F1-scores\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Specification\n",
    "We have divided the reviews to positive and negative according to their scores \"1 or 2\" to as negative and \"4\" and \"5\" to positive. Then we use TF-IDF vectorizer to get features for these reviews. We then train a logistic regression classifier and achieved the scores as mentioned above. After training, we want to assess the importance of each crime word in reviews. However, we have **two challenges** here; **Challenge I:** the words of crimes are limited and many crimes might be commented in different words (e.g. word \"robbed\" is not captured if we only consider \"robbery\"). **Solution I:** to solve this we use GPT-5 using a prompt and ask it to expand our vocabulary for each crime word. The specifics are shown in our notebooks. For each crime word like \"robbery\", we get all subcrime words like \"robbed\", \"robbery\", etc. **Challenge II:** How should we compute a score for each crime? **Solution II:** One way is to get the TF-IDF score for that crime in a review. However, this does not account for the label information and how that crime affects the general opinion of people regarding train stations. Thus, affected by a method like Grad-CAM from computer vision, we calculate $word_{\\text{TF-IDF \\:Score}} \\times word_{Logistic\\: Regression\\: Weight\\: for \\:that \\:word}$. Then, we sum all these subcrime scores for each crime across all train stations in each neighborhood. This way, for each neighborhood, we extract a level of concern for each crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results Analysis\n",
    "We observe that in most neighborhoods' train stations, robbery is the most concerning problem. Homicide and arson seem to be two other concerning crimes. Specifically, we see that for the most important neighborhood in the city (Loop), robbery is a very important concern. We have to note that in our analysis, because of the sum, prevalent crimes like robbery are weighted more. But, we didn't change the calculation, since the prevelance of a crime is definitely related to its level of concern. Some neighborhoods, like Catham, Engle Wood, and Lower West Side, seem to have more dengarous train stations as people have the concern of homicide. "

    "### Crime-Event Relationship Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed the relationship between public events and crime rates in each neighborhood:\n",
    "- **Challenges:** The dangerous neighborhoods with high crime rates have few events, and neighborhoods with a large number of events have a low crime rate. This makes it challenging to assess the relationship between public events and the crime rate due to high variance. Thus, we keep only the top neighborhoods in crime and events; subsequently, we take the intersection of these neighborhoods, resulting in 3 neighborhoods \"loop\", \"humboldt park\", and \"shouth shore\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computation:** Subsequently, for each neighborhood, we compute all unique event and non-event dates, and we take the average of crime incidents in event and non-event dates in these three neighborhoods (first figure in Crime-Event Relationship Analysis). Additionally, for a fine-grained analysis, we compute the percentage of each crime in event vs non-event dates (second figure in Crime-Event Relationship Analysis). This analysis shows us what specific crimes might rise or fall due to events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Figure 1 Analysis:** In the first figure, we observe that, interestingly, the rate of crime significantly drops on average during event dates. This might be due to the presence of as more strict security measures. The mean crime incidents are shown in log scale since the crime rate is much higher during event dates. The exact crime rates are shown in the table below. This is very interesting, as it is in contradiction with what we believed earlier that during event dates, crimes might soar.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | Neighborhood   | Non-Event Dates | Event Dates |\n",
    "|:------|:---------------|-----------------|:------------|\n",
    "| 0     | south shore    | 36.254416       | 0.550453    |\n",
    "| 1     | humboldt park  | 30.409355       | 0.345455    |\n",
    "| 2     | loop           | 56.191919       | 0.290710    |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Figure 2 Analysis:** In the second figure, we observe that a violent crime like battery has a higher percentage in event dates across neighborhoods compared to non-event dates. Whereas a crime like deceptive practices has a much higher rate during event dates. This is expected, as during event dates, a large group of people gathers, and the conditions for such actions are more suitable. Criminal damage has a bit higher percentage during event dates, since there is probably more communication and incidents are more likely to happen. Theft experiences an inconsistent shift in different neighborhoods. Interestingly, theft has a large increase in proportion compared to non-event dates, probably because the loop is very busy and the conditions for theft become very suitable as compared to South Shore and Humboldt Park, which are relatively less busy areas."
